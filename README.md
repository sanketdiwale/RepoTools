RepoManagement should be added as a submodule to your repo as:
git submodule add https://github.com/sanketdiwale/RepoTools.git
git submodule init
git submodule update

For more details on submodules on adding, removing and updating them , refer to (2)

The scripts in this folder can then called to execute some of the standard workflow operations described in (1)

The scripts are relatively short and hopefully are self explanatory for people familiar with git and the workflow mentioned in (1), so for now not documenting how to use them.
